# openscad

My library of design templates written in .scad.
.scad is the working file format for OpenSCAD; a programmatic modelling software.
OpenSCAD is FOSS software (Free & Open Source Software) used to generate .STL (Stereolithography files) used primarily in 3D printing.
.STL files represent an object using points and polygons, making objects with very few polygons look 'faceted', however with the right tweaks, faceted portions can be smoothed by using more faces.
My example files contain annotations that explain how to specify the amount of faceting and how to get high resolution prints.
There are major advantages to making 3D objects programmatically rather than using a mouse an GUI, mainly the designs have a small footprint and are easily transportable.
