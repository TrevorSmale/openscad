## About

OpenSCAD is FOSS software (Free & Open Source Software) used to generate .STL (Stereolithography files) programatically.
There are major advantages to making 3D objects programmatically rather than using a mouse and GUI, mainly the designs have a small footprint and are easily transportable.
This is a library of downloadable template files I made while practicing OpenSCAD.
